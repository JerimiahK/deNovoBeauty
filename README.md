## Description
This project is a front end React application for the start up beauty company De Novo Beauty. It utilizes the React framework, Material UI, and vanilla JavaScript to make a clean, modern user interface that is easy to navigate and use. It also follows the Atomic Design file architecture principals to acheive professional level file structure. The website features a homepage that features what the company is, an about page that describes the owner and her mission statement, a services page that details the services provided by this business, and a connect page where users can contact the owner via a form, as well as an embedded Google map to display the location of the business for people to easily get directions.
