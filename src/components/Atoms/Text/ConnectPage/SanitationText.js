            <p>
                I abide by the Colorado State Department of Regulatory Agencies' sanitation guidelines for Estheticians. I use Barbicide, an industry standard sterilizer, for all non-porous objects, where they sit for a minimum of 10 minutes, per industry guidelines. With single-use items, disposables will not be used more than once on a client or product. I also sanitize with 90% isopropyl alcohol after Barbicide soaks, and services to ensure all bacteria are gone.
