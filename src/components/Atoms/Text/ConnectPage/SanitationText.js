            </h4>
            <p>
                I abide by the Colorado State Department of Regulatory Agencies'
                sanitation guidelines for Estheticians. I use Barbicide, an
                industry standard sterilizer, for all non-porous objects, where
                they sit for a minimum of 10 minutes, per industry guidelines.
                With single-use items, disposables will not be used more than
                once on a client or product. I also sanitize with 90% isopropyl
                alcohol after Barbicide soaks, and services to ensure all
                bacteria are gone.
            </p>
