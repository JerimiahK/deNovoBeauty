                Party, party, party! Do you have a party that you want a fun
                activity for? Look no further! I will travel to you, or you and
                your guests can meet at my location! Each party quote depends on
                how many guests, and what exactly you're looking to do! I offer
                group tutorials, so you can ask all the questions and play with
                fun products!
