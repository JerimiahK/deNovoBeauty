                    Victoria Sanchez is originally from San Diego, CA but has
                    resided in Denver, CO more than 15 years. Her passion for
                    makeup started at a young age, and through hard work and
                    dedication, she turned that passion into a full-fledged
                    career. Victoria received her Esthetician's degree in
                    October of 2021, graduating as the valedictorian with the
                    highest volume of sales and services out of all five
                    classes. After graduating, Victoria received her license the
                    following January and immediately started getting to work!
                    Victoria was a licensed makeup artist at Sephora for over a
                    year, perfecting her craft. Victoria specializes in
                    combining and customizing services for each client, giving
                    each person a unique and personal experience that will leave
                    them satisfied and confident in their looks. She strives to
                    make everyone and everyone feel comfortable and welcome in
                    her space.

                    She is currently in school for graphic design and hopes to
                    pair her graphic design with her esthetician skills. You can
                    find her digital art prints in her makeup room! Anytime
                    Victoria isn't in the office or on location, she enjoys the
                    outdoors in the beautiful Colorado landscape. With the Rocky
                    Mountains in her backyard, she loves hiking during the
                    Spring and Summer. On the hot days, Victoria loves to
                    explore new lakes around the state to enjoy kayaking and
                    paddle boarding. She loves nature so much that one summer
                    she traveled in her car for two months straight to visit
                    each National Park in the Western United States. All this
                    traveling translates into inspiration for her unique,
                    original, and playful services.
