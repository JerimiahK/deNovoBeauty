                    Victoria Sanchez is originally from San Diego, CA but has
                    resided in Denver for more than 15 years. Her passion for
                    makeup started at a young age and through hard work and
                    persistence, has turned into a full-fledged career. She
                    received her Esthetician's degree in October of 2021,
                    graduating as the valedictorian with the highest volume of
                    sales and services out of all five classes. She then
                    received her license the following January, and immediately
                    started getting to work at sharpening her professional
                    skills. Since obtaining her license, she has worked at
                    medical spas teaching her valuable techniques, as well as
                    earning her certificates in Chemical Peel,
                    Microdermabrasion, and Dermaplanting. She specializes in
                    combining and customizing services for each client, giving
                    each person a unique, and personal experience that will
                    leave them satisfied and confident with the way they look.

                    She is currently in school for graphic design and hopes to
                    pair her graphic design with her esthetician skills. When
                    she is not doing makeup, you can find Victoria enjoying
                    being outdoors in the beautiful Colorado landscape. With the
                    Rocky Mountains being in her backyard, she is an avid lover
                    of hiking during the Spring and Summer. On the really hot
                    days she loves to explore new lakes around the state to
                    enjoy kayaking and paddle boarding. She loves nature so much
                    that one summer she traveled in her car for two months
                    straight to visit each National Park in the Western United
                    States. All of this traveling translates into inspiration
                    for her work which is why she offers such unique, original,
                    and playful services.
